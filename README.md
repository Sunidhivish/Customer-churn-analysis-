The project follows a standard data science pipeline:

Data Preparation: The process starts by uploading the raw CSV dataset to Google BigQuery, a cloud-based data warehouse, for efficient storage and querying.

SQL-Based Analysis: Using SQL queries in BigQuery, the project compares key metrics between churned and active customers. This involves calculating averages for Tenure, Total Spend, and Usage Frequency, as well as analyzing the distribution of Contract Length and other categorical data.

Data Visualization: The results are then visualized in an interactive dashboard using Google Looker Studio. The dashboard includes charts that visually highlight the key differences between the two customer groups, making the findings easy to understand for non-technical stakeholders.
